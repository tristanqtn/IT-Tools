## Introduction

As an IT enthusiast, I often encounter repetitive tasks and challenges in my workflow. To address these issues and make my work more efficient, I have developed a set of tools that automate certain processes, provide useful functionalities, and generally make my IT tasks more manageable.

Feel free to explore and use these tools in your own projects or workflows. Contributions and suggestions are also welcome.

## Tools

### [Backup Maker](./BackupMaker/)

**Backup Maker** is a versatile command-line utility designed to automate and secure your file backup process. It seamlessly integrates with 7Zip and AxCrypt, creating a two-layered protection system. The tool first generates a 7Zip archive, securing it with a user-defined password. Subsequently, the archive is encrypted using AxCrypt with a second password. The program then ensures the safe transfer of this encrypted backup to an external SSD, designated with the letter 'E:'. Additionally, it takes care of safeguarding a password vault, providing a comprehensive solution for data protection. Personalization options allow users to adapt the tool to their specific directory structures, offering a streamlined and efficient approach to data backup in IT workflows.

### [Auto Updater](./AutoUpdater/)

**Auto Updater Tool** is a script designed to streamline the updating process of local packages installed through Chocolatey. Going beyond simple updates, this tool automates the management of your Chocolatey packages by not only updating them to the latest versions but also performing a thorough cleanup. This includes removing unused packages, cleaning up outdated versions, and eliminating residual files left behind by uninstalled packages. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, the Auto Updater Tool enhances your Chocolatey experience by maintaining a clean and up-to-date software environment.
